Reads input from System.io to List (of Graphs(sorted List)),
no check for input,
no exception handling,
puts graphs to HashMap<Key,Value>,
 - key is the lowest number,
 - value - list of the greatest values of graphs,
gets size of sorted Map,
decreases size if key or value was already mentioned,
prints solution

Some tests developed.
